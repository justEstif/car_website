## Key words:

Web scraping, TypeScript, Svelte

## Project Overview:

This project serves as the capstone project for my introduction to SvelteKit course. I have been interested in building a full-stack project using SvelteKit, and will be using the opportunity to create a car website.

I am currently considering purchasing a car, and I want to create a website for that purpose. This project is intended to cement my understanding of SvelteKit, TypeScript, API's and SQL.

## Website introduction:

The website mainly serves four purposes:

1. Display used cars for sale within 100miles of user's location (or in the US).
2. Create an account, and save the cars you are interested in
3. Search for a car by brand, distance, year, millage, and price.
4. Create site-only used car sale posts

## Limitations

Since there are no available api to use, web scraping and html parsing are used to extract information from (#TODO).

The used car postings made within the website will not be shared elsewhere on the internet.

## Instructions:

Visit the website at: #TODO
